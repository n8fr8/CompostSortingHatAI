This is built on the fun and amazing demo repo from here: https://github.com/gregsadetsky/sagittarius

You can see a realtime, unedited YouTube demo video of my kid testing it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Ya5rLj64Q

I have added the following:
- Hook it up to ElevenLabs for better voice
- Tuned the prompt to work for detecting if an item should be composted, recycled or trashed, with a dash of humour in the response
